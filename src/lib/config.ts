		`Helloo! My name is Tayfun and I enjoy creating things. My interest in programming started
		back in 2018 when I was in school. I decided that I want to get notified if there were
		changes on our substition schedules (Vertretungungsplan). So I began teaching myself Python
		and hooking that script on a Raspberry Pi. It didn't last long until my classmates wanted to
		take advantage of the program as well. It became very popular at school. In the end there
		were approximately 150 registered users. I was constantly adding new features to the program
		and had a lot of fun. ‚Äî turns out web scraping our schedule at school taught me a lot about
		Python, managing a server and programming in general!`,
		`Fast forward to today and I‚Äôve had the privilege of studying IT-Security at Ruhr-Universit√§t
		Bochum.`,
